I'm Cale111, a person interested in technology and electronics.

My hobbies are mostly just tech stuff like programming, 3D Modelling, Digital Art, and electronics, but that's not all, my hobbies unrelated to technology include traditional art, music, and some others.

My favourite programming language right now is Python, but I can write Javascript and basic C++ as well.
