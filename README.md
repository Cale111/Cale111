I'm Cale111, someone interested in technology and electronics.

My hobbies are mostly just tech stuff, like programming, 3D Modelling, Digital Art, and so on, but that's not everything, I have non-technology related hobbies too, including traditional art, music, and some others.

My favourite programming language right now is Python, but I can write Javascript and basic C++ as well.
