### I'm Cale111, but you can call me Cake!

I'm really interested in technology and electronics. Some hobbies I have are playing video games, programming, making art, listening to music, and other things too. I really like creative mediums - it's the whole reason I got into programming, and everything else.

Programming can be a creative outlet, as it allows you to make whatever you want! Especially in games, you can come up with any world you want.

For programming, my main language is Python. It's the one I've been using for years. I know other languages to a lesser degree, but because programming knowledge is largely transferable between languages, it's not difficult for me to pick new ones up.
