### I'm Cale111, but you can call me Cake!

I'm really interested in technology and electronics. Some hobbies I have are playing video games, programming, making art, listening to music, and other things too. I really like creative mediums - it's the whole reason I got into programming, because I could make whatever I wanted.

For programming, my main language is Python. It's the one I've been using for years. I know other languages to a lesser degree, but because programming knowledge is largely transferable between languages, it's not difficult for me to pick new ones up.
